# Magento 1 PaymentFailedEmail module

By default, there is no possibility in Magento 1 to disable sending an email with a failed payment.

This module adds a field in the admin panel in which you can disable the sending these emails.

Admin Panel -> System -> Configuration -> Sales -> Checkout -> Payment Failed Emails -> Enable Sending a Failed Payment Email
